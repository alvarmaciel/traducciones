    Science, as you know, my little one, is the study
    of the nature and behaviour of the universe.
    It’s based on observation, on experiment, and measurement,
    and the formulation of laws to describe the facts revealed.
    
    In the old times, they say, the men came already fitted with brains
    designed to follow flesh-beasts at a run,
    to hurdle blindly into the unknown,
    and then to find their way back home when lost
    with a slain antelope to carry between them.
    Or, on bad hunting days, nothing.
   
    The women, who did not need to run down prey,
    had brains that spotted landmarks and made paths between them
    left at the thorn bush and across the scree
    and look down in the bole of the half-fallen tree,
    because sometimes there are mushrooms.
   
    Before the flint club, or flint butcher’s tools,
    The first tool of all was a sling for the baby
    to keep our hands free
    and something to put the berries and the mushrooms in,
    the roots and the good leaves, the seeds and the crawlers.
    Then a flint pestle to smash, to crush, to grind or break.
    
    And sometimes men chased the beasts
    into the deep woods,
    and never came back.
    
    Some mushrooms will kill you,
    while some will show you gods
    and some will feed the hunger in our bellies. Identify.
    Others will kill us if we eat them raw,
    and kill us again if we cook them once,
    but if we boil them up in spring water, and pour the water away,
    and then boil them once more, and pour the water away,
    only then can we eat them safely. Observe.
    
    Observe childbirth, measure the swell of bellies and the shape of breasts,
    and through experience discover how to bring babies safely into the world.
    
    Observe everything.
    
    And the mushroom hunters walk the ways they walk
    and watch the world, and see what they observe.
    And some of them would thrive and lick their lips,
    While others clutched their stomachs and expired.
    So laws are made and handed down on what is safe. Formulate.
    
    The tools we make to build our lives:
    our clothes, our food, our path home…
    all these things we base on observation,
    on experiment, on measurement, on truth.
    
    And science, you remember, is the study
    of the nature and behaviour of the universe,
    based on observation, experiment, and measurement,
    and the formulation of laws to describe these facts.
    
    The race continues. An early scientist
    drew beasts upon the walls of caves
    to show her children, now all fat on mushrooms
    and on berries, what would be safe to hunt.
    
    The men go running on after beasts.
    
    The scientists walk more slowly, over to the brow of the hill
    and down to the water’s edge and past the place where the red clay runs.
    They are carrying their babies in the slings they made,
    freeing their hands to pick the mushrooms.
